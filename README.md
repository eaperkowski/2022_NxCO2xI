# 2022 NxCO2 growth chamber experiment
Repository for a growth chamber experiment investigating effects of soil nutrient availability and symbiotic nitrogen fixation on leaf and whole plant acclimation responses to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>. Repository contains data and working analyses. Folder contents are as follow:

 - `chamber_calibrations` = contains files and scripts for calibrating Percival growth chamber temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 readouts
 - `data_sheets`          = contains cleaned datafiles used in subsequent analyses
 - `leaf_area`            = contains raw leaf images for focal leaves and leaves used for chlorophyll extractions
 - `licor_cleaned`        = contains cleaned LI-6800 files. Files cleaned from `licor_raw` folder using 'readLicorData' R package
 - `licor_raw`            = contains raw LI-6800 plain text files with no further modifications
 - `NxCO2_protocols`      = contains relevant procedures and protocols for any lab analyses
 - `scripts`              = contains all data cleaning, data processing, and analysis R scripts
 - `working_drafts`       = contains working manuscript and presentation drafts
